Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Want to implement a command yourself? Check out our GitHub issues. Any issue with the "Help Wanted" or "Good First Issue" label would be a great place to start :)

Once you have added the feature, please open a PR https://github.com/kevslinger/bot-be-named/pulls.

Write Documentation

We're always looking for more documentation. That can come in the form of official documentation (e.g. what you're reading right now), or in the form of tutorials for installation, usage, tips and tricks, etc.
